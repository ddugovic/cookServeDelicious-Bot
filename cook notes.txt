1. Have both cycle through #1-4
  
   a) Finds illuminated number

   b) Starts recipe search then beging cooking

   c) Completes recipe and then goes back to cycling through #1-4

   d) When I goes back to cycling it will start where it left off 

   e) ex: #2 is illuminated, complete it then start at #3


2. Cycling shouldn't cause a problem for cooking food that needs the number keys to be used
since they are 2 seprate steps

#throw in a sleep timer after COOKING anything so the outer loop doesent accidentaly click on the cooking item 


3. Cooking method

i. Can only cook 1 item at a time
ii. cook multiple items causes the cooking_timer to go out of range
iii. Also cooking multiples items causes many other problems

once cooking begins it start looping through the 3 remaining numbers
if it start cooking a 2nd item it starts loop through the 3 remaining
because it deletes the previous number it had in memory. I need it save
multiple cooking numbers

#getto solution involves using multiple compare_imagesCooking() functions
everytime I cooking function is called it calls a different compare_imagesCooking() function
compare_imagesCooking1()
compare_imagesCooking2()
compare_imagesCooking3()
compare_imagesCooking4()
compare_imagesCooking5()
compare_imagesCooking6()
compare_imagesCooking7()
compare_imagesCooking8()

cooking_tracker = [i]

compare_imagesCooking + i + ()



since I can only cook x items at a time only x are needed

I can use a global variable? or something to keep track of what function is next

shit is going to be slow but it should at least work for now.
